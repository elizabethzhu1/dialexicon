      I. Introduction
    </span>
<span class="italic">
<br>
<br>
Before the Law</span> by Franz Kafka, is an abstruse parable subject to multiple readings. The author 
explores existential themes, but no overt universal moral is clearly imparted. Instead, the story 
requires a careful unpacking. While the metaphorical system seems unclear at times, similarities 
can be drawn between the struggle of the country man to attain the law with the reader's pursuit 
to glean understanding. At first, one might see both quests as futile; the man fails in his mission 
while the reader navigates an ambiguity within the text that proves difficult to reconcile. Simply 
establishing this connection without further questioning, however, neglects aspects of the narrative. 
Specifically, why is the man unsuccessful? Is it Kafka's premise that the law is a fallacy or is 
unattainable by definition, or are the conceptions, strategies, and methods of the man flawed? 
If indeed they are faulty, what are the implications for the reader; ought one re-examine and 
re-craft his/her/their expectations, modes, and analyses of the parable? In other words, by creating 
the man as the vehicle for the reader, then laying bare his mistakes, perhaps the author actually 
asserts the possibility of meaning but only if pursued through more critical approaches.

<br>
<span class="text-3xl text-blue-800">
    II. An Absence of Meaning
  </span>
<br>
<br>
Although the absence of overt meaning initially suggests a confusing metaphorical
system, the parable constructs a parallel between the man and the reader, as well as their
respective journeys. Here, Kafka's metaphorical system is unconventional in that the referents
are not exclusively objects but involve actions, including that of engaging with the text. Namely,
as the man repeatedly attempts to gain "admittance to the law" (131), but is thwarted, the reader
is continually searching for the moral of the narrative which remains elusive as well. The man
and the reader both start in earnest and do not expect such "difficulties", as it "should be
accessible at all times and to everyone" (131). As the story continues, and the man "makes many
attempts to be admitted" (131), it becomes clear that his increasingly desperate efforts from
bribes to flea interrogations, are in vain. Likewise the reader sincerely but unsuccessfully
wrestles with the text, unable to decipher the parable's message through traditional paths.
<br>
<br>
Finally, while the man lay diminished and dying, the guard extinguishes any hope of entry
through the door as he roars, "I am going now to shut it" (132). The unceremonious closing of
the door likewise signals the disappointment of the reader's quest. At the end of the parable, the
author has drawn in the reader's participation in order to understand the experience of the man;
the former and latter are denied a gratifying conclusion despite their diligent attempts. Yet, this
takeaway might not fully complete the project set forth by Kafka. His ambitions for the reader
are broader; questions and opportunities remain.

    III. Transcending the Metaphorical System
  </span>
<br>
<br>
While the author creates this metaphorical system, the paradox is that he subsequently
cracks the door open for the reader to dismantle and transcend it. The reader, unlike the man,
ultimately enjoys a privileged perspective: they can see the inefficacy of the man's
efforts. If the reader were to end the analysis there, the metaphorical system would be relatively
complete: both man and reader are ultimately left confused, frustrated, and unfulfilled. But Kafka
offers further possibility, a second chance. Having not gained the satisfaction of a typical
parable, the reader can now choose an extended investigation: why has the man failed, and why
has the reader up to now? While the answers to these questions are neither simple nor obvious,
the author does leave breadcrumbs, inviting the reader to grapple. For example, the man is
fundamentally passive. He endlessly "wait(s) until he gets permission to enter" (131) rather than
trying to push past the guard or taking other creative risks. Further, he lacks any sense of
introspection. He always seeks the law outside of himself, as if the truth can only come from an
external source, by "peer(ing) through the gateway" (131). Even in the face of defeat, he never
steps up, digs deep, and re-examines that course. In revealing the man's errors, the author
indicates that the alternative, namely an active engagement, is integral to the search for meaning.
Self-questioning, reflection, and reframing, are similarly important factors. While the man can no
longer pursue his goal, the reader can re-embark with this new perspective. In so doing, the
referents would no longer be parallel, thereby fracturing the metaphorical system.
<br>
<br>
<span class="text-3xl text-blue-800">
    IV. Critiquing Power Structures
  </span>
<br>
<br>
Challenging the reader to break down the metaphorical system serves further purposes as
well. While it is almost impossible to know Kafka's intentions, the text reveals an attitude
towards power structures, specifically how authority is portrayed. The system in the parable
demands the man's obedience; he has unequivocal faith in "the law" (which can stand in for
various constructs like religion, culture, politics, etc.) Rather than question its existence and
nature, the man assumes the law's validity and status, despite a lack of evidence. Similarly, he
accepts the authority of the doorkeeper and his threats, even though there is no proof of other
doorkeepers, "each more powerful than the last". The system perpetually teases with
postponed rewards, and never delivers: "It is possible ... but not at the moment" (131). Instead, it
ensnares and addicts. The doorkeeper assumes complete domination; the man serves up all of his
wealth, health, and value. Because this control structure is portrayed so negatively, when reading
the parable a desire develops to stand up to hegemony and re-examine the premises provided at
the outset. Presenting the man's blind allegiance as a cautionary tale, the author provokes doubt
and calls for a rethinking of power structures. This extends to the reader as well; Kafka
communicates that in approaching the text, one ought to be skeptical of dynamics established by
those in control. By soliciting the reader to challenge the metaphorical system initially set forth,
the author encourages a critical questioning of power, even if that very authority is Kafka himself.

    V. Conclusion
  </span>
<br>
<br>
By presenting this opportunity to transcend the metaphorical system in <span class="italic">Before the Law</span>, Kafka 
asserts that meaning can be realized, albeit through a critical process and a nimble approach. 
It is not an easy, guaranteed endeavor, and demands a lot of the reader. The expectation of 
absolute revelation is misguided; instead, the priority is on the journey, which may require 
uncomfortable reframing and reflection. Like Keats' conception of negative capability, it can 
also be pleasurable, embracing the adventure and its uncertainties. And while Kafka emphasizes 
this search, both fraught and sublime, he leaves the door of interpretation ajar for the reader. 
In his Diaries Kafka writes, "Life's splendor forever lies in wait about each one of us in all 
its fullness, but veiled from view, deep down, invisible, far off. It is there, though, not hostile, 
not reluctant, not deaf. If you summon it by the right word, by its right name, it will come" (396). 
So, perhaps Kafka is an unexpected agent of hope; through reflection and creative acts, insight can 
be gleaned, even if only partially and obliquely, as if through a glass darkly (Corinth. 13.12).
