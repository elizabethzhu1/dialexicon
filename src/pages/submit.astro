        </span>
<span class="italic">
    Dialexicon</span> is a journal that publishes exceptional philosophical essays written by high school students around the world.

We are looking for papers that are 1200 to 1500 words, and make a compelling, original philosophical argument.
Every fall, we release prompts for students to write about, but we also accept papers on any relevant topic.
Typically, we look for papers that approach current events through a philosophical lens, as reflected in our prompts.

If your paper has been accepted for publication, we will contact you by email. Published authors will have their essays 
published online, and are invited to participate in an interview with <span class="italic">Dialexicon</span> about their paper and interest in philosophy.

The top paper will be awarded a $100 prize, and we typically publish 5 to 7 papers each year to <span class="italic">Dialexicon</span>.

If you are interested in submitting, the upcoming Dialexicon Vol. 4 will be opening to submissions in Fall 2024!
