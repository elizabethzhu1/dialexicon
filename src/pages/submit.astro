        </span>
<span class="italic">
Dialexicon</span> is a journal that publishes exceptional philosophical essays written by high school students around the world.

We look for papers that approach current issues through a philosophical lens, as reflected in our prompts. That being said,
past papers have ranged in topic from the ethics of violent protests to the nature of identity to whether free will exists.

The mission of <span class="italic">Dialexicon</span> is to encourage youth to critically and philosophically investigate current issues. As a result, 
we look for papers that express original ideas, address multiple perspectives, and produce a rigorous philosophical argument

We are looking for papers that are <span class="italic">1200 to 1500 words</span>, and make a <span class="italic">compelling, original philosophical argument</span>.
Every fall, we release prompts for students to write their papers on, but we also accept papers on any relevant topic.

If your paper has been accepted for publication, we will contact you by email. Published authors will have their essays 
published online, and are invited to participate in an interview with <span class="italic">Dialexicon</span> about their paper and interest in philosophy.

The top paper will be awarded a $100 prize, and we typically publish 5 to 7 papers each year to <span class="italic">Dialexicon</span>.

If you are interested in submitting, the upcoming Dialexicon Vol. 4 will be opening to submissions in Fall 2024.
Before writing, please read the following steps and guidelines to ensure that your paper is eligible for publication.
